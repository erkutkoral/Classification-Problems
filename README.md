  <h3 align="center">Titanic Survial Prediction</h3>

  <p align="center">
    In my senior year at the Industrial Engineering department, I wanted to change my career to a completely different path based on the courses that I was interested in my undergraduate thesis. This is my journey to starting this field and learning Python, SQL environments.

## About The Project

In my university years, I took Calculus, Probability, Statistics, Linear Algebra, Operations Research, Algorithms, Heuristic Methods. These courses pushed me to work on data processing methods and this subject in my senior year. In that time, I learned Python, SQL, Data Visualization, EDA, Data Cleansing, Machine Learning and used that knowledge in 3 projects. First applied methods in the Telco Customer Churn Project, second Math Student's Grades Prediction and last applied all things I learned in my last version of undergraduate thesis which is ICU Admission Prediction for Covid19 Patients.

## Technologies-Libraries-Frameworks

Python Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Imbalanced-Learn.

## Roadmap

1. Literature Review
2. CRISP-DM Methodology
  * Business Understanding
  * Data Understanding
  * Data Preparation
  * Modeling
  * Evaulation
  * Deployment ( We did not deploy this model but the next step would be this)
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Exloratory Data Analysis with Data Visualization
5. Feature Selection
6. Balancing the Data Set
7. Modeling (Classification models which is Decision Trees, GBM, XGBM, LIGHT GBM and stacked with some combinations)
8. Evaulation
